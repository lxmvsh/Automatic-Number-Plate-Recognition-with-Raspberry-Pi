# Automatic-Number-Plate-Recognition-with-Raspberry-Pi

The issue of security is very paramount in any organisation, especially such organisations as college institutions. Therefore we intend to aid in security of the institution by bringing up a hardware solution on ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) using Raspberry pi that involves individualâ€™s vehicle to get recognised by the system via their respected vehicle number that is further stored on database to check whether the vehicle is registered one or not. It is an embedded system which has numerous applications and challenges. Typical ANPR systems are implemented using proprietary technologies and hence are costly. The system does not require any user interaction rather it automatically captures the numbers written over the number plate through the camera module. From this project, we hope to build an alternative security system for institutes.
